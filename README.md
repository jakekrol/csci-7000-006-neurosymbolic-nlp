# How to run

- Load vector encodings from `data/`
- Load ground truth pairwise distances from `data/`. If desired, can recompute using encodings.
- View `data.ipynb` for encoding steps
  - See https://github.com/jakekrol/genefusion for data generation details
- Train models with `train.ipynb`
- Evaluation is located in `train.ipynb` and `evaluation.ipynb`
- Contact jacob dot krol at colorado dot edu for questions
